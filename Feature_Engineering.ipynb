        "### 1. What is a parameter?  \n",
        "A **parameter** is a numerical value that defines a characteristic of a model. In machine learning, parameters are the variables that the learning algorithm adjusts during training to minimize the error. Examples include weights and biases in neural networks.  \n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. What is correlation?  \n",
        "**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. It tells how one variable changes concerning another. It can be positive, negative, or zero.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### What does negative correlation mean?  \n",
        "A **negative correlation** means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, an increase in exercise duration is negatively correlated with body weight.  \n",
